# FitnessTracker

## Tech Stack

**Web framework**: Flask (Python)
**Database**: SQLAlchemy 
**Styling**: Bootstrap/HTML/CSS

## General Idea

A web app that allows you to track workouts: 
- Split
- Calendar with day/week/monthly view 
- Exercise type within split 
	- Num sets/reps/weight 
- Graphs to show change over time (max weight, average weight, max/average reps)
- Weight tracking (if you want)
- Food logging? Not like MFP but more of a food diary-type beat
